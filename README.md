Include features for adding details like release year, tracklist, album cover images, and artist biographies.
3. Search and Retrieval:

Develop a robust search functionality to allow users to find music based on various criteria (artist, album, genre, etc.).
Implement sorting and filtering options to enhance the user experience.

4. Playlist Management:

Enable users to create, edit, and delete playlists.
Allow for the addition of songs to playlists and the ability to reorder tracks.
